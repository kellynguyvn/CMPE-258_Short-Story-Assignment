# CMPE 258 Short Story Assignment
### Assignment Overview
This assignment involves a deep dive into recent research on large language models (LLMs) or foundation models, with a focus on advanced and non-standard modalities such as tabular, graph, and timeseries foundation models. Your task is to select a paper written in the second half of 2023 or in 2024, ideally a survey paper. If a survey is not available, select a paper from a notable conference such as NeurIPS 2023, ICML 2024, or ICLR 2024.
### Approach
The paper chosen was: [Towards Reasoning in Large Language Models: A Survey](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-acl.67.pdf), a survey paper written by Jie Huang and Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2023, to conduct this review and short story on. In this repository contains these artifacts/deliverables:
1. **Research Summary Paper**: Provides a brief summary, overview, and personal insights/research on the surey paper as well as the topic.
